    summary: `I am a Multimedia Computing student with a passion for creating engaging digital experiences.
Throughout my academic journey, I've worked with tools like Unity, Unreal Engine, and Construct to
explore interactive media and creative technologies. My background in graphic design and content
creation has helped me develop both technical and creative skills, while internships and part-time roles
have strengthened my communication, adaptability, and teamwork. I'm excited to contribute to projects
that combine design, technology, and user experience in meaningful ways.`,
